//In a Directed Graph, Cconnection between nodes have direction.
//The degree of node is number of edges connected to the node.
//A weighted graph is a graph is which the edges have values corresponding to weights.
//A Unweighted Graph has no weight to its edges, so every edge is the same as any other adge.
//A cyclic graph, there is at least one cycle, meaning there is a path from at least one node back to itself.
//A Acyclic graph, means the graph contains is no cycles.
//Dense Graph - close to the maximum number of edges.
//Sparse Graph - the number of edges close to the number of nodes in the graph.
//In a simple directed graph, the maximum number of edges will be equal to (n*(n-1)) where n is number of nodes.
//In a simple undirected graph, the maximum number of edges will be equal to (n*(n-1)/2) where n is number of nodes.
